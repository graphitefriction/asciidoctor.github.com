== Stylesheets embedded by default

In earlier versions of Asciidoctor, we decided to link to the stylesheet by default, rather than embedding it into the document, in order to keep the document lightweight.
As a result, what we've found is that new users often don't discover the default stylesheet and are confused when many of the features that rely on CSS do not work as expected.

We would rather have Asciidoctor ``just work'' out of the box for new users and teach experienced users how to link the stylesheet, rather than the other way around.
Therefore, in Asciidoctor 0.1.4, stylesheets are embedded in the document by default (i.e., +linkcss+ is not set).
If no stylesheet is specified, then it's the default stylesheet that's embedded.

New users no longer have to fiddle with the +linkcss+ or +copycss+ attributes.
In fact, the +copycss+ attribute is no longer necessary.
Now, if the +linkcss+ attribute is set, the default stylesheet, [file]_asciidoctor.css_, is copied to the +stylesdir+ within the output directory.

CAUTION: Asciidoctor does not yet copy the user-specified stylesheet when the +linkcss+ stylesheet is set.

_Resolves issue {issue-ref}/428[#428]._

Asciidoctor will also embed the stylesheet that provides the theme for either the CodeRay or Pygments syntax highlighter.

.For CodeRay
If the +source-highlighter+ attribute is +coderay+ and the +coderay-css+ attribute is +class+, the CodeRay stylesheet is:

* _embedded_ if +linkcss+ is not set (default behavior)
* _copied_ to the file [file]_asciidoctor-coderay.css_ inside the +stylesdir+ folder within the output directory if +linkcss+ is set

.For Pygments
If the +source-highlighter+ attribute is +pygments+ and the +pygments-css+ attribute is +class+, the Pygments stylesheet is

* _embedded_ if +linkcss+ is not set (default behavior)
* _copied_ to the file [file]_asciidoctor-pygments.css_ inside the +stylesdir+ folder within the output directory if +linkcss+ is set

== Classy code listings

We know how important code is to you.
It's important to us too.
That's why we made sure code listings received some nice refinements in this release.
Adding source code to documentation has never been so easy, and rewarding!

=== Callouts don't get caught in copy

Previously, when a reader visiting an HTML page generated by Asciidoctor would select source code from a listing that contains callouts and copy it, the callout numbers would get caught up in the copy.
If the reader pasted that code and tried to run it, likely the extra characters from the callouts caused compile or runtime errors.
Readers shouldn't have to understand why the documentation is putting extra characters in the clipboard.
Copy and paste should just work.

In this release, we used some CSS ninja moves to prevent the callouts from being selected.
No matter how hard the reader tries (or how little they understand about the problem), those callouts just won't get selected.

On the other side of the coin, you don't want the callout annotations messing up your source code either.
We can't play fancy CSS games in raw source code, but we can leverage line comments!
You can now tuck your callouts neatly inside line comments.
Asciidoctor will recognize the line comments characters in front of a callout number, optionally offset by a space, and remove them when rendering the document.

Here are the line comments that are supported:

```
----
line of code  // \<1>
line of code   # \<2>
line of code  ;; \<3>
----
<1> A callout behind a line comment for C-style languages.
<2> A callout behind a line comment for Ruby, Python, Perl, etc.
<3> A callout behind a line comment for Clojure.
```

Here's how it looks when rendered:

----
line of code  // <1>
line of code  # <2>
line of code  ;; <3>
----
<1> A callout behind a line comment for C-style languages.
<2> A callout behind a line comment for Ruby, Python, Perl, etc.
<3> A callout behind a line comment for Clojure.

WARNING: Asciidoctor enforces that callouts be placed at the end of the line.

The focus is to ensure callouts are an aid, not a pain.
Speaking of pain, what about callouts in XML?
Read on to find out.

_Resolves issue {issue-ref}/478[#478]._

=== XML-friendly callouts

XML doesn't have line comments, so our "tuck the callout behind a line comment" trick doesn't work here.
We played around with the syntax and came up with something we think works, and looks, rather nice.
All we have to do is stretch out the angled brackets around the callout number so the callout itself becomes an XML comment.

`<1>` => `<!--1-->`

Here's how it appears in a listing:

```
[source,xml]
----
<section>
  <title>Section Title</title>  \<!--1-->
</section>
----
<1> The section title is required.
```

Here's how it looks when rendered:

[source,xml]
----
<section>
  <title>Section Title</title>  <!--1-->
</section>
----
<1> The section title is required.

Notice the comment is gone.
Now both you and the reader can copy and paste source code containing callouts to your heart's content and no errors will hitch a ride.

_Resolves issue {issue-ref}/582[#582]._

=== Callouts, no highlighting for you!

Our tricks with callouts aren't quite over yet.
We had reports that callouts weren't getting replaced in some cases when the CodeRay source highlighter was used (e.g., +source-highlighter=coderay+).

It turns out, the problem is that the very precense of the callouts in the code, whether behind line comments or not, causes them to get caught up in the highlighting and mangled.
The trick here is to pull the callouts out of the source code before highlighting, then restore them after highlighting is done.
That way, the source highlighter never sees them, and we can be sure that they end up where they're supposed to be, unmangled.

There's nothing you need to change to take advantage of this improvement.
It just works when using CodeRay or Pygments.

_Resolves issue {issue-ref}/534[#534]._

""
Did you say Pygments?
""

That's right. Asciidoctor now lets you use Pygments for source code highlighting!

=== Syntax highlighting with Pygments

The most popular source code highlighter in the AsciiDoc world, perhaps even the whole world, is http://pygments.org[Pygments].
Until now, Asciidoctor only integrated with CodeRay for "server-side" source highlighting, mostly because it's also written in Ruby.

Thanks to the awesome folks at GitHub, Pygments now has a nice Ruby wrapper library named https://github.com/tmm1/pygments.rb[pygments.rb] that makes integrating with it a cinch.
So I figured, why not?

In order to use Pygments with Asciidoctor, you need to install Pygments (and Python, if you don't have it yet).
You then need to install the pygments.rb RubyGem.
Something like:

 $ "`\which apt-get || \which yum || \which brew`" install pygments
 $ gem install pygments.rb

To activate it in Asciidoctor, assign the value +pygments+ to the +source-highlighter+ attribute in your document's header.

```
:source-highlighter: pygments
```

Voila!
You've not got "pygments" in your code.

[comment, Sarah]
> We may also need to ship a default stylesheet to be embedded or copied to the output directory.
Was this done?

[comment.reply, Dan]
yes, we use the one from Pygments. I did some tweaking to get it looking reasonable by default, but the other themes choices for Pygments are as ugly as sin, so eventually we'll want to provide our own.

_Resolves issue {issue-ref}/538[#538]._

Additional improvements:

* The default CodeRay theme has been updated so it conforms better to the default Asciidoctor styles.
* Syntax highlighting is no longer disabled if an explicit +subs+ attribute is used on a source listing (as long as +specialcharacters+ is in the subs list)

=== To wrap or to scroll

Previously, the Asciidoctor stylesheet was configured to prevent line wrapping (e.g., +white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: normal+) in listing and literal blocks.
This behavior isn't always desirable because it causes the browser window to scroll if the content overflows the width of the page.
For many, this horizontal scrolling is considered a greater readability problem than line wrapping.

Since there are two camps on this preference, neither setting will please both.
For that reason, we've made this behavior configurable in Asciidoctor 0.1.4.

By default, the default Asciidoctor stylesheet now wraps long lines in listing and literal blocks by applying the CSS +white-space: pre-wrap+ and +word-wrap: break-word+.
The lines are wrapped at word boundaries, similar to how most text editors wrap lines.

There are two ways to prevent lines from wrapping so that horizontal scrolling is used instead:

* nowrap block option
* prewrap document attribute

You can use the +nowrap+ option on literal or listing blocks to prevent lines from being wrapped in the HTML:

[source, java, options="nowrap"]
----
public class ApplicationConfigurationProvider extends HttpConfigurationProvider
{
   @Override
   public Configuration getConfiguration(ServletContext context)
   {
      return ConfigurationBuilder.begin()
               .addRule()
               .when(Direction.isInbound().and(Path.matches("/{path}")))
               .perform(Log.message(Level.INFO, "Client requested path: {path}"))
               .where("path").matches(".*");
   }
}
----

When the +nowrap+ option is used, the +nowrap+ class is added to the +<pre>+ element.
This class changes the CSS to +white-space: pre+ and +word-wrap: normal+.

To apply the nowrap option globally, just set the +prewrap+ attribute on the document.

```
:prewrap:
```

When the +prewrap+ attribute is set, the +nowrap+ class is added to any +<pre>+ element even when the +nowrap+ option is absent.

Now, you can use the line wrapping strategy that works best for you and your readers.

== Mark your lists

We make all kinds of lists.
Now you can make more of them, faster, with AsciiDoc.

=== Getting Things Done using checklists

If you use AsciiDoc to track the completion of tasks, get ready to start checking things off your list!
List items in AsciiDoc can now be marked complete using checklists.

Checklists (i.e., task lists) are unordered lists that have items marked as checked (+[*]+ or +[x]+) or unchecked (+[ ]+).
Here's an example:

.Checklist

```
- [*] checked
- [x] also checked
- [ ] not checked
-     normal list item
```

TIP: Not all items in the list have to be checklist items, as the previous example shows.

When checklists are rendered to HTML, the checkbox markup is transformed into an HTML checkbox with the appropriate checked state.
The +data-item-complete+ attribute on the checkbox is set to 1 if the item is checked, 0 if not.
The checkbox is used in place of the item's bullet.

Since HTML generated from AsciiDoc is usually static, the checkbox is set as disabled to make it appear as a simple mark.
If you want to make the checkbox interactive (i.e., clickable), add the +interactive+ option to the checklist:

.Checklist with interactive checkboxes

```
[options=interactive]
- [*] checked
- [x] also checked
- [ ] not checked
-     normal list item
```

As a bonus, if you enable font-based icons, the checkbox markup (in non-interactive lists) is transformed into a font-based icon!

.Checklist with font-based checkboxes

```
:icons: font

- [*] checked
- [x] also checked
- [ ] not checked
-     normal list item
```

=== More bullets and numerations styles for lists

Asciidoctor 0.1.4 offers additional bullet and numbering options for lists.
The list marker (bullet or numeration style) is set using the list's block style. 

Asciidoctor now recognizes all the unordered list bullets available in HTML and DocBook.

The unordered list marker can be set using any of the following block styles:

* square
* circle
* disc
* none or no-bullet (indented, but no bullet)
* unstyled (no indentation or bullet) (HTML only)

NOTE: These styles are supported by the default Asciidoctor stylesheet.

When present, the style name is assigned to the unordered list element as follows:

For HTML:: the style name is assigned to the +class+ attribute on the +<ul>+ element.
For DocBook:: the style name is assigned to the +mark+ attribute on the +<itemizedlist>+ element.

Here's an unordered list that has square bullets:

```
[square]
* one
* two
* three
```

For ordered lists, Asciidoctor now supports the lowergreek and decimal-leading-zero numeration styles in addition to the existing options.
These two new styles are only supported in the HTML backend (DocBook doesn't recognize these options).

The full list of numeration styles that can be applied to an ordered list are as follows:

[cols="2,3", width="50%"]
.Asciidoctor ordered list numeration styles
|===
|Block style |CSS list-style-type

|arabic
|decimal

s|decimal{ast}
s|decimal-leading-zero

|loweralpha
|lower-alpha

|upperalpha
|upper-alpha

|lowerroman
|lower-roman

|upperroman
|upper-roman

s|lowergreek{ast}
s|lower-greek
|===
{ast} New in Asciidoctor 0.1.4 +

Here are a few examples showing various numeration styles as defined by the block style shown in the header row:

|===
|[arabic]{ast} |[decimal] |[loweralpha] |[lowergreek]

a|
. one
. two
. three

a|
[decimal]
. one
. two
. three

a|
[loweralpha]
. one
. two
. three

a|
[lowergreek]
. one
. two
. three
|===

{ast} default numeration if block style is not specified

TIP: Custom numeration styles can be implemented using a custom role.
Define a new class selector (e.g., +.custom+) in your stylesheet that sets the +list-style-type+ property to the value of your choice.
Then, assign the name of that class as a role on any list to which you want that numeration applied.

When the role shorthand (+.custom+) is used on an ordered list, the numeration style is no longer omitted.

== More time savers

=== Implicit header row for tables

After adding link:/news/2013/05/31/asciidoctor-0-1-3-released/#shorthand-notation-for-setting-code-csv-code-and-code-dsv-code-table-formats[shorthand notation] in Asciidoctor 0.1.3 for specifying the table format (e.g., +,===+, +;===+), it seems tedious to still have to use a block attribute line to enable the header row (e.g, +[options="header"]+ or +[%header]+).

It's now possible to enable the header row based on how you layout the table.
Asciidoctor 0.1.4 introduces the following conventions to determine if the first row should become the header row:

. The first line of content inside the table block delimiters is not empty.
. The second line of content inside the table block delimiters is empty.
. The +options+ attribute has not been specified in the block attributes.

If all of these rules hold, then the first row of the table is treated as a header.
Building on existing conventions, if the +cols+ attribute has not been specified, the number of columns in the table is set to the number of columns in the first row (i.e., the header row).

Here's an example of a table that has an implicit header row:

```
|===
|A |B |C <1>

|A-1
|B-2
|C-3

|A-2| B-2| C-2

|A-3
|B-3
|C-3
|===
```
<1> Satisfies the convention to be made the header row.

Here's how it looks when rendered:

|===
|A |B |C

|A-1
|B-1
|C-1

|A-2 |B-2 |C-2

|A-3
|B-3
|C-3
|===

CAUTION: You can arrange the cells in the remaining rows however you want.
Note, however, that we're considering using a similar convention for enabling the footer in the future.
Thus, if you rely on this convention to enable the header row, it's advised that you not put all the cells in the last row on the same line unless you intend on making it the footer row.

_Resolves issue {issue-ref}/387[#387]._

=== Shorthand notation for block options

In traditional AsciiDoc syntax, block options are specified using the +options+ (or +opts+) attribute in the block's attribute list.
Asciidoctor 0.1.4 allows options to be specified using the block shorthand notation, in which the option name is prefixed with a percent sign (+%+).

Consider a table block with the following three options:

.Block options using traditional AsciiDoc syntax

```
[options="header,footer,autowidth"]
|===
|Cell A |Cell B
|===
```

Here's how the options are written using the shorthand notation (+%+):

.Block options using Asciidoctor shorthand notation

```
[%header%footer%autowidth]
|===
|Cell A |Cell B
|===
```

Let's consider the options when combined with other shorthand notations. 

.Traditional AsciiDoc syntax

```
[horizontal, role="properties", options="step"]
property 1:: does stuff
property 2:: does different stuff
```

.Asciidoctor shorthand notation

```
[horizontal.properties%step]
property 1:: does stuff
property 2:: does different stuff
```

_Resolves issue {issue-ref}/481[#481]._

=== Shorthand notation on formatted (i.e., quoted) text

The shorthand notation introduced on blocks in Asciidoctor 0.1.3 can now be used on inline formatted (i.e., quoted) text as well.

Here's an example of an inline anchor and formatted text that has two roles:

.Traditional AsciiDoc syntax

```
[[free_the_world]][big goal]_free the world_
```

.Asciidoctor shorthand notation

```
[#free_the_world.big.goal]_free the world_
```

NOTE: Since quoted text doesn't have an id, the +id+ attribute is converted to an anchor that precedes the text.

In the HTML backend, this syntax becomes:

```html
<a id="free_the_world"><em class="big goal">free the world</em>
```

In the DocBook backend, it becomes:

```xml
<anchor id="free_the_world" xreflabel="free the world"/><emphasis><phrase
role="big goal">free the world</phrase></emphasis>
```

_Resolves issue {issue-ref}/517[#517]._

[comment, Sarah]
> The open question is where to put this shorthand in inline macros. Putting it within the square brackets already present makes the most sense, but the attribute position is not as clear cut as it was with delimited blocks. That may need to be addressed in a separate issue.
QUESTION: Was this issue addressed?

[comment, Dan]
yes, I proposed a solution in https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/issues/567

Additional improvements:

* The attribute list preceding formatted text can be escaped using a backslash (e.g., +\[role]*bold*+). In this case, the text will still be formatted, but the attribute list will unescaped and output verbatim. {issue-ref}/421[#421]

=== Inter-document references

In AsciiDoc, the xref inline macro is used to create a cross-reference (i.e., link) in the content of one section to the top of another section.
Asciidoctor 0.1.4 extends this functionality by allowing a link to be established to a section in another AsciiDoc document.
This eliminates the need to use direct links between documents that are coupled to a particular backend (e.g., HTML links).
It also captures the intent of the author to establish a reference to a section in another document.

Here's how an xref is normally defined in AsciiDoc:

```
Refer to <<section-b>> for more information.
```

This xref creates a link to a section with the id _section-b_.

Let's assume the xref is defined in the document [file]_document-a.adoc_.
If the target section is in a separate document, [file]_document-b.adoc_, the author may be tempted to write:

```
Refer to link:document-b.html#section-b[Section B] for more information.
```

However, this link is coupled to HTML output.
What's worse, if [file]_document-b.adoc_ is included in the same master as [file]_document-a.adoc_, then the link will refer to a document that doesn't even exist!

These problems can be alleviated by using an inter-document xref:

```
Refer to <<document-b.adoc#section-b,Section B>> for more information.
```

The id of the target is now placed behind a hash symbol (+#+).
Preceding the hash is the name of the reference document (the file extension is optional).
We've also added a label since Asciidoctor cannot (yet) resolve the section title in a separate document.

When Asciidoctor generates the link for this xref, it first checks to see if [file]_document-b.adoc_ is included in the same master as [file]_document-a.doc_.
If not, it will generate a link to [file]_document-b.html_, intelligently substituting the original file extension with the file extension of the output file.

```
<a href="document-b.html#section-b">Section B</a>
```

If [file]_document-b.adoc_ is included in the same master as [file]_document-a.doc_, then the document will be dropped in the link target and look like the output of a normal xref:

```
<a href="#section-b">Section B</a>
```

Now you can create inter-document references without the headache.

_Resolves issue {issue-ref}/417[#417]._


=== No more dropped lines!

By default, the original AsciiDoc processor drops the entire line if it contains a reference to a missing attribute (e.g., +\{bogus}+).
This "feature" was added for use in templates written for the original processor, which also used the AsciiDoc syntax.

This behavior is not needed in Asciidoctor since templates are written in a dedicated template language (e.g., ERB, Haml, Slim, etc).
More critically, the behavior is frustrating for the author, editor or reader.
To them, it's not immediately apparant when a line goes missing.
Discovering its absense often requires a full (and tedious) read-through of the document or section.

Asciidoctor 0.1.4 introduces two attributes to alleviate this inconvenience: +attribute-missing+ and +attribute-undefined+.

==== attribute-missing

The attribute +attribute-missing+ controls how missing references are handled.
By default, missing references are left intact so it's clear to the author when one hasn't been satisfied since, likely, the intent is for it to be replaced.

This attribute has three possible values:

+skip+:: leave the reference in place (default setting)
+drop+:: drop the reference, but not the line
+drop-line+:: drop the line on which the reference occurs (compliant behavior)

Consider the following line of AsciiDoc:

```
Hello, {name}!
```

Here's how the line is handled in each case, assuming the +name+ attribute is not defined:

[horizontal]
+skip+:: Hello, \{name}!
+drop+:: Hello, !
+drop-line+:: {empty}

==== attribute-undefined

The attribute +attribute-undefined+ controls how expressions that undefine an attribute are handled.
By default, the line is dropped since the expression is a statement, not content.

This attribute has two possible values:

+drop+:: substitute the expression with an empty string after processing it
+drop-line+:: drop the line that contains this expression (default setting and compliant behavior)

The option +skip+ doesn't make sense here since the statement is not intended to produce content.

Consider the following declaration:

```
{set:name!}
```

Depending on whether +attribute-undefined+ is +drop+ or +drop-line+, either the statement or the line that contains it will be discarded.
It's reasonable to stick with the compliant behavior, +drop-line+, in this case.

TIP: We recommend putting any statement that undefines an attribute on a line by itself.

_Resolves issue {issue-ref}/523[#523]._

=== Ignore front matter added for static-site generators

Many static site generators (i.e., Jekyll, Middleman, Awestruct) rely on "front matter" added to the top of the document to determine how to render the content.
Front matter typically starts on the first line of a file and is bounded by block delimiters (e.g., +---+).

Here's an example of a document that contains front matter:

```
--- <1>
layout: default <2>
--- <1>
= Document Title

content
```
<1> Front matter delimiters
<2> Front matter data

The static site generator removes these lines before passing the document to the AsciiDoc processor to be rendered.
Outside of the tool, however, these extra lines can throw off the processor.

If the +skip-front-matter+ attribute is set, Asciidoctor 0.1.4 will recognize the front matter and consume it before parsing the document.
Asciidoctor stores the content it removes in the +front-matter+ attribute to make it available for integrations.
Asciidoctor also removes front matter when reading include files.

TIP: Awestruct can read front matter directly from AsciiDoc attributes defined in the document header, thus eliminating the need for this feature.

_Resolves issue {issue-ref}/502[#502]._

=== Process multiple source files from the CLI

The Asciidoctor CLI (i.e., the +asciidoctor+ command) is no longer single-minded!
You can pass multiple source files (or a file name pattern) to the Asciidoctor CLI and it will process all the files in turn.

Let's assume there are two AsciiDoc files in your directory, [file]#a.adoc# and [file]#b.adoc#.
When you enter the following command in your terminal:

 $ asciidoctor a.adoc b.adoc

Asciidoctor will process both files, transforming [file]#a.adoc# to [file]#a.html# and [file]#b.adoc# to [file]#b.html#.

To save you some typing, you can use the glob operator (+*+) to match both files using a single argument:

 $ asciidoctor *.adoc

The shell will expand the previous command to the one you typed earlier:

 $ asciidoctor a.adoc b.adoc

You can also render all the AsciiDoc files in immediate subfolders using the double glob operator (+**+) in place of the directory name:

 $ asciidoctor **/*.adoc

To match all files in the current directory and immediate subfolders, use both glob patterns:

 $ asciidoctor *.adoc **/*.adoc

If the file name argument is quoted, the shell will not expand it:

 $ asciidoctor '*.adoc'

This time, the text +*.adoc+ gets passed directly to Asciidoctor instead of being expanded to [file]#a.adoc# and [file]#b.adoc#.
In this case, Asciidoctor handles the glob matching internally in the same way the shell does (when the file name is not in quotes)--with one exception.
Asciidoctor can match files in the current directory and subfolders at any depth using a single glob pattern:

 $ asciidoctor '**/*.adoc'

Now that's saving you some typing!

_Resolves issue {issue-ref}/227[#227]._

Additional improvements:

* The +asciidoctor+ command writes to the specified output file if the input is stdin. {issue-ref}/500[#500] +
+
For example, the following command writes to +output.html+ instead of to the console:

 $ echo "content" | asciidoctor -o output.html -

== Formatting galore

=== Awesome icons everywhere!

Asciidoctor 0.1.4 introduces an inline macro for inserting an icon at an arbitrary place in paragraph content. 

Here's an example that inserts a tags icon in front of a list of tag names:

```
icon:tags[] ruby, asciidoctor
```

Here's how this example renders in the HTML backed when the +icons=font+ attribute is set:

```html
<div class="paragraph">
<p><i class="icon-tags"></i> ruby, asciidoctor</p>
</div>
```

More importantly, here's how it _looks!_

icon:tags[] ruby, asciidoctor

You can even give the icon color by assigning it a role:

```
icon:tags[role="blue"] ruby, asciidoctor
```

which appears as:

icon:tags[role="blue"] ruby, asciidoctor

If you aren't using the font-based icons, Asciidoctor looks for the images on disk, in the +iconsdir+, naturally.
Here's how it renders in the HTML backend when the +icons+ attribute is not set or empty:

```html
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="./images/icons/tags.png" alt="tags"></span> ruby, asciidoctor</p>
</div>
```

Here's how it renders in the DocBook backend, regardless of the +icons+ attribute value:

```xml
<inlinemediaobject>
  <imageobject>
    <imagedata fileref="./images/icons/tags.png"/>
  </imageobject>
  <textobject><phrase>tags</phrase></textobject>
</inlinemediaobject> ruby, asciidoctor
```

[comment, Dan]
FIXME: I think this section can be moved to the documentation. We can pull out a few highlights to showcase above, but that's it.

==== Relationship to the inline image macro

The inline icon macro is similar to the inline image macro with a few exceptions:

* If the +icons+ attribute has the value +font+, the macro will translate to a font-based icon in the HTML backend (e.g., +<i class="icon-tags"></i>+)
* If the +icons+ attribute does not have the value +font+, or the backend is DocBook, the macro will insert an image into the document that resolves to a file in the +iconsdir+ directory (e.g., +<img src="./images/icons/tags.png">+)

The file resolution strategy when using image-based icons is the same used to locate images for the admonition icons. The file extension is set using the +icontype+ attribute, which defaults to +png+.

==== Icon sets

At the moment, the font-based icon set is assumed to be http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome[Font Awesome]. You can see the possible icon name options on the http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons[icons page] page. Support for other icon sets is being discussed in issue {issue-ref}/539[#539].

When you aren't using font-based icons, or you are using the DocBook backend, the icon set is only limited by which icons you have in your +iconsdir+ directory.

==== Customizing the icon

The icon macro has a few attributes that can be used to modify the size and orientation of the icon. At the moment, these are specific to Font Awesome and therefore only apply to HTML output when icon fonts are enabled.

* size (first positional attribute) - scales the icon; possible values: large, 2x, 4x
* rotate - rotates the icon: possible values: 90, 180, 270
* flip - flips the icon: possible values: horizontal, vertical

The first unnamed attribute is assumed to be the size. For instance, to make the icon twice the size as the default, simply add +2x+ inside the square brackets.

```
icon:heart[2x]
```

This is equivalent to:

```
icon:heart[size=2x]
```

The previous example emits the following HTML:

```html
<i class="icon-heart icon-2x"></i>
```

To rotate and flip the icon, specify these options using attributes:

```
icon:shield[rotate=90, flip=vertical]
```

The previous example emits the following HTML:

```html
<i class="icon-shield icon-rotate-90 icon-flip-vertical"></i>
```

NOTE: This markup is subject to change. In particular, the +<i>+ element may be replaced with the +<span>+ element.

==== Additional metadata

Like an inline image, it's possible to add additional metadata to an inline icon.

Below are the possible attributes that apply to both font-based and image-based icons:

* link - The URI target used for the icon, which will be rendered as a link
* window - The target window of the link (when the +link+ attribute is specified) (HTML backend)

Here's an example of an icon rendered as a link:

```
icon:download[link="http://rubygems.org/downloads/asciidoctor-0.1.3.gem"]
```

The previous example emits the following HTML:

```html
<a class="image" href="http://rubygems.org/downloads/asciidoctor-0.1.3.gem"><i class="icon-download"></i></a>
```

Below are the possible attributes that apply in the case that font-based icons are _not_ in use:

* alt - The alternate text on the +<img>+ tag (HTML backend) or text for +<inlinemediaobject>+ (DocBook backend)
* width - The width applied to the image
* height - The height applied to the image
* title - The title of the image displayed when the mouse hovers over it (HTML backend)
* role - The role applied to the element that surrounds the icon

Currently, the inline icon macro doesn't support any options to change it's physical position (such as alignment left or right).

Additional improvements:

* Asciidoctor now uses Font Awesome 3.2.1 (loaded from cdnjs.com) {issue-ref}451/[#451]

=== Put images in their place

Images are a great way to enhance the text, whether its to illustrate an idea, show rather than tell or just help the reader connect with the text.

Out of the box, images and text behave like oil and water.
Images don't like to share space with text.
They are kind of "pushy" about it.
That's why we focused on tuning the controls in the image macros so you can get the images and the text to flow together.

There are two approaches you can take when positioning your images:

. Named attributes
. Roles

==== Positioning attributes

Asciidoctor already supports the +align+ attribute on block images to align the image within the block (e.g., left, right or center).
In this release, we added the +float+ named attribute to both the block and inline image macros.
This attribute pulls the image to one side of the page or the other and wraps block or inline content around it, respectively.

Here's an example of a floating block image.
The paragraphs or other blocks that follow the image will float up into the available space next to the image.
The image will also be positioned horizontally in the center of the image block.

.A block image pulled to the right and centered within the block

```
image::tiger.png[Tiger,200,200,float="right",align="center"]
```

Here's an example of a floating inline image.
The image will float into the upper-right corner of the paragraph text.

.An inline image pulled to the right of the paragraph text

```
image:linux.png[Linux,150,150,float="right"]
You can find Linux everywhere these days!
```

When you use the named attributes, CSS gets added inline (e.g., +style="float: left"+).
That's bad practice because it can make the page harder to style when you want to customize the theme.
It's far better to use CSS classes for these sorts of things, which map to roles in AsciiDoc terminology.

==== Positioning roles

Here are the examples from above, now configured to use roles that map to CSS classes in the default Asciidoctor stylesheet:

.Image macros using positioning roles

```
[.right.text-center]
image::tiger.png[Tiger,200,200]

image:linux.png[Linux,150,150,role="right"]
You can find Linux everywhere these days!
```

The following table lists all the roles available out of the box for positioning images.

.Roles for positioning images
[cols="1h,5*^"]
|===
|{empty} 2+|Float 3+|Align

|Role
|left
|right
|text-left
|text-right
|text-center

|Block Image
|{y}
|{y}
|{y}
|{y}
|{y}

|Inline Image
|{y}
|{y}
|{n}
|{n}
|{n}
|===

Merely setting the float direction on an image is not sufficient for proper positioning.
That's because, by default, no space is left between the image and the text.
To alleviate this problem, we've added sensible margins to images that use either the positioning named attributes or roles.

If you want to customize the image styles, perhaps to customize the margins, you can provide your own additions to the stylesheet (either by using your own stylesheet that builds on the default stylesheet or by adding the styles to a docinfo file).

==== Framing roles

It's common to frame the image in a border to further offset it from the text.
You can style any block or inline image to appear as a thumbnail using the +thumb+ role (or +th+ for short), also in the default stylesheet.

NOTE: The +thumb+ role doesn't alter the dimensions of the image.
For that, you need to assign the image a height and width.

Here's a very common example for adding an image to a blog post.
The image floats to the right and is framed to make it stand out more from the text.

```
image:logo.png[role="related thumb right"] Here's text that will wrap around the image to the left.
```

Notice we added the +related+ role to the image.
This role isn't technically required, but it gives the image semantic meaning.

==== Controlling the float

When you start floating images, you may discover that too much content is floating around the image.
What you need is a way to clear the float.
That is provided using another role, +group+.

Let's assume that we've floated two images so that they are positioned next to each other and we want the next paragraph to appear below them.

```
[.left]
.Image A
image::a.png[A,240,180]

[.left]
.Image B
image::b.png[B,240,180,title="Image B"]

Text below images.
```

When this example is rendered and viewed a browser, the paragraph text appears to the right of the images.
To fix this behavior, you just need to "group" the images together in a block with self-contained floats.
Here's how it's done:

```
[.group]
--
[.left]
.Image A
image::a.png[A,240,180]

[.left]
.Image B
image::b.png[B,240,180]
--

Text below images.
```

This time, the text will appear below the images where we want it.

[comment, Dan]
NOTE: AsciiDoc does not allow positional and named attributes to be mixed in macros; it's either one or the other; the only exception is the "alt" attribute, which is hard-coded in AsciiDoc to be read from first-positional attribute

=== Role-playing for text enclosed in backticks

To align with other formatted (i.e., quoted) text in AsciiDoc, roles can now be assigned to text enclosed in backticks.

Given:

```
[rolename]`escaped monospace text`
```

the following HTML is produced:

```html
<code class="rolename">escaped monospace text</code>
```

Using the new shorthand notation in Asciidoctor 0.1.4, an id (i.e., anchor) can also be specified:

```
[#idname.rolename]`escaped monospace text`
```

which produces:

```html
<a id="idname"></a><code class="rolename">escaped monospace text</code> 
```
 
Keep in mind that text enclosed is not subject to other inline substitutions, but rather passed through as is.

_Resolves issue {issue-ref}/419[#419]._

=== Markdown-style horizontal rules

Asciidoctor continues to expand support for (reasonable) Markdown syntax by recognizing Markdown horizontal rules.
The motivation here is to ease migration (both of the content and the mind).

To avoid conflicts with the syntax of AsciiDoc block delimiters, only 3 repeating characters (+-+ or +*+) are recognized.
As with Markdown, whitespace between the characters is optional.

.Recognized Markdown horizontal rule syntax

```
---

- - -

***

* * *
```

A macro definition for the Markdown horizontal rules is included in the AsciiDoc compatibility file so they can be recognized by the +asciidoc+ command as well.

== Go remote

=== Include content from a URI

The include directive can now include content directly from a URI.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to include AsciiDoc content:

```
:asciidoctor-source: https://raw.github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/master

\include::{asciidoctor-source}/README.adoc[]
```

Here's another example showing how to include specific lines of a source file:

```
:asciidoctor-source: https://raw.github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/master

[source,ruby]
----
\include::{asciidoctor-source}/lib/asciidoctor/helpers.rb[lines=10..30]
----
```

Since this is potentially dangerous feature, it's disabled if the safe mode is SECURE or greater.
Assuming the safe mode is less than SECURE, you must also set the +allow-uri-read+ attribute to permit Asciidoctor to read content from a URI.

Reading content from a URI is obviously much slower than reading it from a local file.
Asciidoctor provides a way for the content read from a URI to be cached, which is highly recommended.

To enable the built-in cache, you must:

* install the gem open-uri-cached
* set the +cache-uri+ attribute

When these two conditions are satisified, Asciidoctor will cache content read from a URI according the to http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html[HTTP caching recommendations].

Additional improvements:

* The include directive now resolves files relative to the current document instead of the root document.
This applies to include directives used inside a file which itself has been included. {issue-ref}/572[#572]

=== Image URLs are rendered, not mangled

AsciiDoc couldn't decide if it wanted to support remote images (i.e., images with a URL target) or not.
While you've always been able to use a URL for block images, both AsciiDoc and Asciidoctor were ignoring inline images that have a URL target.

Even the block images would fall apart in AsciiDoc if you defined the +imagesdir+ attribute to set the location of your local images.
AsciiDoc was mangling the image URL in this case by blindly prefixing the URL with this path.
Doh!

Things were messy.
They aren't anymore.
You can now reference images served from any URL (e.g., your blog, an image hosting service, your docs server, etc.) and never have to worry about downloading the images and putting them somewhere locally.
Asciidoctor just gets it right.
We've also updated the AsciiDoc compatibility file so that AsciiDoc gets it right too.

Here are a few examples of images that have a URL target:

.Block image with a URL target

```
imagesdir: ./images

image::http://inkscape.org/doc/examples/tux.svg[Tux,250,350]
```

.Inline image with a URL target

```
imagesdir: ./images

You can find image:http://inkscape.org/doc/examples/tux.svg[Linux,25,35] everywhere these days.
```

NOTE: The value of +imagesdir+ is ignored when the image target is a URI.

If you want to avoid typing the URL prefix for every image, and all the images are located on the same server, you can use the +imagesdir+ attribute to set the base URL:

.Using a URL as the base URL for images

```
:imagesdir: http://inkscape.org/doc/examples

image::tux.svg[Tux,250,350]
```

This time, the +imagesdir+ _is_ used since the image target is not a URL (the +imagesdir+ just happens to be one).

_Resolves issue {issue-ref}/470[#470]._

[comment, Dan]
There's an open question pending at the end of this issue about adding an imagesurl attribute

=== YouTube and Vimeo videos

The +video::[]+ macro now supports videos from external video hosting services like YouTube and Vimeo.
To use this feature, put the video ID in the macro target and the name of the hosting service in the first positional attribute.
Asciidoctor will put the two together and generate the correct embed code to insert the video in the HTML output.

Here's an example that shows how to embed a YouTube video:

```
video::rPQoq7ThGAU[youtube, 640, 360]
```

and one that shows how to embed a Vimeo video:

```
video::67480300[vimeo, 400, 300]
```

You can control the video settings using additional attributes and options on the macro.
For instance, you can offset the start time of playback using the +start+ attribute and enable autoplay using the +autoplay+ option.

```
video::rPQoq7ThGAU[youtube, 640, 360, start=60, options=autoplay]
```

_Resolves issue {issue-ref}/587[#587]._

== Backend boost

=== Multiple custom template directories

Custom templates can now be stored in multiple directories.
That means you can build on an existing backend by copying only the templates you want to modify.
Then, just pass both the directory holding the original templates and the directory containing your customized templates when you invoke Asciidoctor.

In the CLI, multiple template directories are specified by using the +-T+ option multiple times.

 $ asciidoctor -T /path/to/original/templates -T /path/to/modified/templates sample.adoc

In the API, multiple template directories are specified by passing an array to the +template_dirs+ option:

```ruby
Asciidoctor.render_file 'sample.adoc', :safe => :safe, :in_place => true,
    :template_dirs => ['/path/to/original/templates', '/path/to/modified/templates']
```

Hack away!

--
> The template_dir option in the API should accommodate an array of strings in addition to a string value. 

1. Does the template engine stuff need to be included?

> NOTE: When multiple template directories are specified, the +template_engine+ option no longer applies (mutually exclusive).  

> As it turns out, we don't have to forbid the use of template_engine when using multiple template directories. 
> Asciidoctor will just look for a folder matching the template engine in each template directory (the same logic that's applied when only one template directory is provided).

2. Does the information Alex provided need to be included in documentation somewhere and/or in this changelog?

> @lordofthejars Note that this is a change to the options. Asciidoctor first looks for :template_dir and, if present, wraps it in an array and assigns it to :template_dirs. If :template_dir is absent, Asciidoctor then looks for template_dirs and expects it to be an Array. The best approach in the fluent API is to allow templateDir to be specified multiple times, and also add a templateDirs method which appends to that running list. Then, just pass the :template_dirs to Asciidoctor.

I think we can leave out this information as it's a design discussion.

=== DocBook 5.0 backend

Asciidoctor 0.1.4 can produce DocBook 5.0 output, which is generated by the +docbook5+ backend.

The output from the +docbook5+ backend only differs from the +docbook45+ backend so far as to make it compliant to the DocBook 5.0 specification.
A summary of the differences are as follows:

* XSD declarations are used on the document root instead of a DTD
* +<info>+ elements for document info instead of +<articleinfo>+ and +<bookinfo>+
* elements that hold the author's name are wrapped in a +<personname>+ element
* the id for an element is defined using an +xml:id+ attribute
* +<link>+ is used for links instead of +<ulink>+
* the URL for a link is defined using the +xlink:href+ attribute

Refer to http://www.docbook.org/tdg5/en/html/ch01.html#introduction-whats-new[What's new in DocBook v5.0?] for more details about how DocBook 5.0 differs from DocBook 4.5.

To use the DocBook 5.0 backend, set the backend to +docbook5+, as shown in this example:

 $ asciidoctor -b docbook5 sample.adoc

Here's a sample DocBook 5.0 document generated by this backend:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<article xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"
    xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" version="5.0" xml:lang="en">

_Resolves issue {issue-ref}/411[#411]._

Additional improvements:

* The +xmlns+ attribute is now added to the root DocBook element by default.
Set the attribute +noxmlns+ to disable this feature.

=== Custom content for the document footer

AsciiDoc allows you to include custom content in the header of the output document (HTML or DocBook) by supplying docinfo files.
In Asciidoctor 0.1.4, docinfo files can be used to add custom content to the footer as well.

Footer docinfo files are differentiated from header docinfo files by adding +-footer+ to the file name.
In the HTML output, the footer content is inserted inside the footer div (i.e., +<div id="footer">+).
In the DocBook output, the footer content is inserted immediately before the ending +</article>+ or +</book>+ element.

.docinfo
If you want to add content to the footer of a specific document, put the content in the file +<docname>-footer.html+ (for HTML output) or +<docname>-footer.xml+ (for DocBook output), where +<docname>+ is the name of the document without the AsciiDoc extension.
Then, set the attribute +docinfo+ in the AsciiDoc source document to enable the feature.

.docinfo1
If you want to add content to the footer of all documents in the same directory, put the content in the file +docinfo-footer.html+ (for HTML output) or +docinfo-footer.xml+ (for DocBook output).
Then, set the attribute +docinfo1+ in the AsciiDoc source document to enable the feature.

.docinfo2
If you want the document to look for either docinfo file, set the attribute +docinfo2+ in the AsciiDoc source document.

_Resolves issue {issue-ref}/486[#486]._

Additional enhancements:

* Attributes are substituted in the content of docinfo files (both header and footer). {issue-ref}/403[#403]
* The "Last updated" line in the footer can be disabled by unassigning the attribute +last-update-label+ {issue-ref}/407[#407]

=== Man pages in AsciiDoc

One of the most interesting uses of AsciiDoc is for creating man pages (short for manual pages) for Unix and Unix-like operating systems.
A man page conforms to a special document structure.
That structure is recognized by AsciiDoc, and now Asciidoctor, when the +doctype+ attribute is set to +manpage+.

When reading an AsciiDoc document using the +manpage+ doctype, Asciidoctor parses the following man page metadata:

* mantitle
* manvolnum
* manname
* manpurpose

The +mantitle+ and +manvolum+ are captured from the document title. 
The +manname+ and +manpurpose+ are taken from the first section of the document, which must be a level 1 section and have content in the format +<manname> - <manpurpose>+.

Here's an example of a man page written in AsciiDoc:

```
= asciidoctor(1)
:doctype: manpage

== NAME
asciidoctor - converts AsciiDoc source files...

== SYNOPSIS
*asciidoctor* ['OPTION']... 'FILE'...
```

From this document, Asciidoctor extracts the following man page-related attributes:

[horizontal]
mantitle:: asciidoctor
manvolnum:: 1
manname:: asciidoctor
manpurpose:: converts AsciiDoc source files...

As you may have guessed from the example above, the Asciidoctor man page is generated from an AsciiDoc document.
Refer to https://raw.github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/master/man/asciidoctor.adoc[the AsciiDoc source of the Asciidoctor man page] to see a complete example.
The man pages for git are also produced from AsciiDoc documents, so you can use those as another example to follow.

_Resolves issue {issue-ref}/488[#488]._

Additional improvements:

* Asciidoctor produces the same output as AsciiDoc when rendering a man page to HTML using the +html5+ backend. {issue-ref}/489[#489]
* The asciidoctor-backends repository hosts an early draft of a https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-backends/tree/master/erb/manpage[manpage backend], which is now used to generate the man page for Asciidoctor

=== Link attributes feature (+linkattrs+) added to AsciiDoc compatibility file

This feature allows attributes in a link macro to be used in the HTML 5 backend.

For example:

endif::linkattrs[]
```

=== +REVIEW+ Incrementing section numbers

AsciiDoc allows section numbering to be toggled on and off throughout a document using the attributes +:numbered:+ and +:numbered!:+, respectively.

For regions of the document where section numbering is turned off, the section numbering will not be incremented.

Given:

```
= Document Title

:numbered!:

== Colophon Section

== Another Colophon Section

== Last Colophon Section

:numbered:

== Section One

== Section Two

== Section Three
```

The sections will be numbered as follows:

```
Colophon Section

Another Colophon Section

Last Colophon Section

1. Section One

2. Section Two

3. Section Three
```

Asciidoctor will always curtail incrementing the section number in regions of the document where section numbers are off.

If +numbered+ is set on the commandline (or API), that overrides the value set in the document header, but it does not prevent the document from toggling the value for regions of the document.

If +numbered!+ is set on the commandline (or API), then the numbers are disabled regardless of toggling within the document.

_Resolves issue {issue-ref}/341[#341]._

=== +REVIEW+ TOC double numbering eliminated

The TOC in the HTML5 backend is now output as an unordered list instead of an ordered list. 
This eliminates the chance of the double numbering problem (native list numbering and section numbering), even in the absence of a stylesheet.
It also removes the need to use +type="none"+ on +<ol>+.

_Resolves issue {issue-ref}/461[#461]._

=== +REVIEW+ Percentage column widths

Instead of taking the percent widths verbatim (like AsciiDoc), Asciidoctor strips the % sign and calculates the percentage based on relative numbers. 
Otherwise, you can end up with percentages that don't add up to 100%, which is technically broken HTML.

Here are some examples:

```
Input: 10%,90%
Output:

<colgroup>
<col style="width:10%;">
<col style="width:90%;"> 
</colgroup>
```

```
Input: 10%,10%
Output:

<colgroup>
<col style="width:50%;">
<col style="width:50%;"> 
</colgroup>
```

== Fixes

=== +REVIEW+ Allow Java::JavaUtil::Map for attributes option type in load API

The type check on the attributes option in the Asciidoctor load API was too restrictive as it did not accommodate a Java Map (Java::JavaUtil::Map). 
This broke the Java integration in 0.1.3.

In Asciidoctor 0.1.4, the type check on the attributes option was relaxed in two ways:

. It checks if the type is a Java::JavaUtil::Map when the RUBY_ENGINE is jruby
. It allows any type that responds to "has_key?" as that's likely a Hash-like object

See asciidoctor/asciidoctor-java-integration#50 for further reference.

=== +REVIEW+ Create a page that lists / recommends editors (#81)

People are often asking which editor they should use for AsciiDoc (phrased as "what's a good AsciiDoc editor?"). Of course, our stance is that you don't need a special editor. We can make that point, but also recommend editors that have good syntax highlighting and perhaps embedded preview.

We want to make sure to recommend open source options first, but I guess it would be biased if we didn't list non-open source editors that are know to be very good (such as Sublime).

=== +REVIEW+ Write documentation for how to create a custom backend (#80)

Write documentation for how to create a custom backend. Information to be covered includes:

What template languages can be used (answer: anything supported by Tilt)
The names of each template and how the file is named
What objects are available to the template
Brief documenation about the structure of an Asciidoctor document object model
Commonly used instance variables and methods in the template
Some started material can be found here:

== Minor, may get cut

=== +REVIEW+ +showtitle+ is an alias for +notitle!+

The +notitle!+ attribute allows the document title to be included in the rendered document when the header and footer are disabled (i.e., embedded). 
However, the double negative is confusing for users. 
Now, the attribute +showtitle+ can be used instead of +notitle!+.

=== +REVIEW+ Style attribute moved to instance variable on AbstractBlock

Style attributes apply to nearly every block, so it made sense to add them as an instance variable on AbstractBlock.

As a result of this change, templates can be simplified from:

```ruby
if (attr :style, nil, false) == 'abstract'
```

to:

```ruby
if @style == 'abstract'
```

AbstractNode convenience methods for +role?+, +role+, +reftext?+ and +reftext+ were also added to further simplify template creation.

=== +REVIEW+ Substitute attributes in docinfo files

Attributes are substituted in docinfo files before including the content into the output.

Given docname-docinfo.xml:

```xml

```

With the following document:

```
= Document Title
Author Name
v1.0, 2013-06-01
:doctype: book
:backend: docbook
:docinfo:
```

Then the output should be:

```xml

<!DOCTYPE book PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.5//EN"
    "http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.5/docbookx.dtd">

=== +REVIEW+ Associate multiple terms with a single labeled list item

Labeled lists now allow for multiple terms to be associated with a single definition. 

_Resolves issue {issue-ref}/532[#532]._

=== +REVIEW+ Printing warning and error messages

Asciidoctor has replaced +puts+ with +warn+.
+Warn+ directs error and warning messages to $stderr. 
This is important because it prevents the messages from being displayed in the rendered document when piped to another command.

The +warn+ method prints messages to $stderr, which can be disabled in the script or when Ruby is invoked by passing +-W0+. 
The +asciidoctor+ command does not yet have a command flag to disable these messages.

=== +REVIEW+ Escaping the attributes that precede formatted text does not disable formatting

If the attribute list that precedes formatted text is escaped using a leading backslash, the text will still be formatted but the attribute list will be treated as regular text.

Given:

```
Try to click a \[disabled]+button+.
```

The HTML output is:

```html
Try to click a [disabled]<code>button</code>.
```

Notice that text is still rendered as monospaced (inside a <code> element), but the attributes (which define the role) have been ignored and treated as plain text.

=== +REVIEW+ Correctly calculates line length in Ruby 1.8

=== +REVIEW+ Open blocks and paragraphs styled as comment are too greedy

Open blocks and paragraphs that have the "comment" style are consuming lines well beyond the terminator. Add tests for these scenarios and fix the parser to stop capturing lines at the proper termination of the block.

Examples:

Open block comment
```
[comment]
--
skip

this block
--

not this text
```

Paragraph comment
```
[comment]
skip
this paragraph

not this text
```

Paragraph comment adjacent to block
```
[comment]
skip
this paragraph
[example]
not this text

=== +REVIEW+ +!+ before an attribute name undefines the attribute

AsciiDoc uses the convention of a +!+ at the end of an attribute name to undefine the attribute. 

```
:numbered!:
```

However, this may read as "numbered not". 
Now, the +!+ can also be placed at the beginning of the attribute name to undefine it.

```
:!numbered:
```

This reads as "not numbered", which is more consistent with programming conventions.

When used on the commandline, the leading +!+ is misinterpretted by the shell as a command. 
However, this is easily solved by quoting (or escaping) the argument value. 

For example:

 -a '!numbered'

or

 -a \!numbered

=== +REVIEW+ Strip HTML tags from doctitle when rendering HTML title element

AsciiDoc uses the document title (i.e., +doctitle+ attribute) to populate the HTML title element in the HTML backend. 
It also permits inline formatting in the +doctitle+; however, the HTML title element must be plain text. 
The HTML backend will strip HTML elements (but not the containing content) from the doctitle before inserting it into the HTML title element.

Example:

AsciiDoc document:

```
= *Document* _Title_
```

As rendered currently:

```html
<title><strong>Document</strong> <em>Title</em></title>
```

Expected:

```html
<title>Document Title</title>
```

Note that a workaround is to define the title attribute on the document, which is used in place of the doctitle in the HTML title element.

Example:

```
= *Document* _Title_
:title: Document Title
```

The HTML 5.1 specification drafts state that the title element is require and it must not be empty. Therefore, I've introduced "Untitled" as the default value, retrieved from the untitled-label document attribute.

=== Cache backend templates

*TODO: What is the benefit of caching?*

*TODO: Where should this be documented (technical?/API manual?*

*TODO: Example code showing how to explicitly disabled it or how a replacement cache can be passed in via the options.

*TODO: Was the option named +template_cache+?

If Asciidoctor is invoked multiple times within the same Ruby process using the same set of custom (Tilt-based) templates, those templates should not be loaded more than once.

This problem can be solved in two ways. 
In the absence of any configuration, the cache can be maintained internally. 
The cache should be partitioned such that the same template name in different backends should be separate keys.

It should also be possible to supply an instance of the cache as an option to the Asciidoctor API. 
That way, it's possible for the client application to control the cache (duration, size, etc) and flush it at will.

A proposed option name for the supplied cache is +template_cache+.

I've observed that Haml seems to have an internal cache of templates its already loaded, whereas Slim seems to read the same template each time it's requested. 
We can probably look at what Haml is doing and clone that. 
There is also a very primitive cache example in Tilt (TiltCache).

I think the global built-in cache should be enabled by default. 
It can either be explicitly disabled or a replacement cache can be passed in via the options.

=== +html-pipeline+ source-highlighter

The source-highlighter option +html-pipeline+, which prepares source code listing blocks to be processed by +jch/html-pipeline+, is now available.

In particular, a source code listing should appear as:

```html
<pre lang="ruby"><code>require 'asciidoctor'
puts Asciidoctor.render('http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor]')</code></pre>
```

TODO: Is this a source code highlighter that is used like CodeRay? (called in attributes/blocks the same way?

=== +REVIEW+ Template engine option for the CLI

The template engine option in the API (i.e., +:template_engine+) is now mapped as an option in the CLI.

 --template-engine

or

 -E

This option is used for resolving the location of a collection of backend templates.
For example, if you execute:

 $ asciidoctor -b html5 -T asciidoctor-backends -E slim

Asciidoctor will look for templates in the directory [file]_asciidoctor-backends/slim/html5_.
