Syntax to cover:
- preface
- index terms
- built-in attributes (such as {author}, {revision}, etc)
- start=n for ordered lists
- horizontal labeled list
- anchor for any block element

- break up attributes and substitutions?
- block metadata (attributes, id, role, etc)
- commandline reference? perhaps another doc? yes

PDF TODO:
- add license on title page (legalnotice tag)
- table cell bg
- show example of section levels
- syntax highlight ruby code (requires switch to https://code.google.com/p/java-syntax-highlighter)
- style sidebar block

== About
endif::basebackend-docbook[]

AsciiDoc is a mature, lightweight markup language for authoring notes, articles, documentation, books, web pages, slide decks and man pages in plain text.
{description}

[NOTE]
====
Several examples focus on the output generated by the HTML backend.
AsciiDoc produces complementary output when generating DocBook.

Most features labeled ``Asciidoctor only'' can be made available to the native AsciiDoc processor by using https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/blob/master/compat/asciidoc.conf[this AsciiDoc configuration file] from the Asciidoctor project.

== Paragraphs

.Normal
----
Paragraphs don't require any special markup in AsciiDoc.
A paragraph is just one or more lines of consecutive text.

To begin a new paragraph, separate it by at least one blank line.
Consecutive lines of text are joined to form a single paragraph.

====

.Line breaks
----
To make a line break, end the line in a space followed by a plus. +
This results in a visible line break (e.g., <br>) between the lines.

Rubies are red. +
Sapphires are blue.

.Literal
----
A normal paragraph.

 A line that begins with one or more spaces is a literal paragraph.
 Literal paragraphs are treated as preformatted text.
 The text is shown in a fixed-width font
 and endlines are preserved.

Another normal paragraph.

TIP: Use one or two spaces to offset a literal paragraph, but no more.

.Admonition
----
NOTE: An admonition paragraph draws the reader's attention to
auxiliary information. Its purpose is determined by the label
at the beginning of the paragraph. The admonition is set apart
from the main content and displayed next to its label or
corresponding icon.

Here are the other built-in admonition types:

TIP: Pro tip...

IMPORTANT: Don't forget...

TIP: The title is the only required element in the document header.

----

CAUTION: The header may not contain blank lines and must be offset from the content by at least one blank line.

[[section-titles]]
== Section Titles (Headers)

.Article doctype
----
= Document Title (Level 0)

== Section Level 1

=== Section Level 2

==== Section Level 3

===== Section Level 4

====== Section Level 5 (Asciidoctor only)
----

[.result]
====
// float is required to create plain headers
[float]

[float]
=== Section Level 2

[float]
==== Section Level 3

[float]
===== Section Level 4

[float]
====== Section Level 5 (Asciidoctor only)
====

WARNING: When using the article doctype (the default), you can only have one level-0 section title (i.e., the document title) and it must be in the document header.

NOTE: The number of equal signs matches the heading level in the HTML output.
For example, _Section Level 1_ becomes an +<h2>+ heading.

.Book doctype
----
= Document Title (Level 0)

== Section Level 1

=== Section Level 2

==== Section Level 3

===== Section Level 4

====== Section Level 5 (Asciidoctor only)

[float]
====== Section Level 5 (Asciidoctor only)

[float]

====

IMPORTANT: There are two other ways to define a section title.
_Their omission is intentional_.
They both require more markup and are therefore unnecessary.
The http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setext[setext] title syntax (underlined text) is especially wasteful, hard to remember, hard to maintain and error prone.
The reader never sees the extra markup, so why type it?
*Be frugal!*

.Explicit id

[[primitives-nulls]]
== Primitive types and null values

.Section anchors and links (Asciidoctor only)

+sectanchors+::
When this document attribute is set, a section icon anchor appears in front of the section title.

+sectlinks+::
When this document attribute is set, the section titles become links.

NOTE: Section title anchors depend on the default Asciidoctor stylesheet to render properly.

== Include Files

.Document parts
----
= Reference Documentation
Lead Developer

This is documentation for project X.

\include::basics.adoc[]

\include::installation.adoc[]

\include::example.adoc[]
----

CAUTION: AsciiDoc does not insert blank lines between adjacent include statements to keep the content separated.
Be sure to add a blank line in the source document to avoid unexpected results, such as a section title being swallowed.

.Common text

NOTE: Blank lines are required before and after a list and are permitted, but not required, between list items.

TIP: You can force two lists apart with a line comment, as the previous example demonstrates.
The text in the comment, (`^`), is optional, but serves as a hint to other authors that this line serves as an "end of list" marker.

====

IMPORTANT: Images are resolved relative to the value of the +imagesdir+ document attribute, which defaults to an empty value.
The +imagesdir+ attribute can be an absolute path, relative path or base URL.
If the image target is a URL or absolute path, the +imagesdir+ prefix is _not_ added.

TIP: You should use the +imagesdir+ attribute to avoid hard coding the shared path to your images in every image macro.

Asciidoctor can "draw" icons using {fontawesome-ref}[Font Awesome^] and CSS.

To use this feature, set the value of the +icons+ document attribute to +font+.
Asciidoctor will then emit HTML markup that selects an appropriate font character from the Font Awesome font for each admonition block.

== Id and Role

.Traditional markup method for assigning +id+ and +role+
----
[[goals]]
[role="incremental"]
* Goal 1
* Goal 2
----

.Shorthand markup method for assigning +id+ and +role+ (Asciidoctor only)
----
[#goals.incremental]
* Goal 1
* Goal 2
----

The +#+ prefix is recognized as shorthand for +id=+, and the +.+ prefix is recognized as shorthand for +role=+.

[TIP]
====
* To specifiy multiple roles using the shorthand syntax, separate them by dots.
+
For example, +[.summary.incremental]+ emits the HTML attribute +class="summary incremental"+.

* The order of +id+ and +role+ values in the shorthand syntax does not matter.
+
For example, +[#goals.incremental]+ and +[.incremental#goals]+ produce the same output.
====

== Comments

.Line
----
// A single-line comment.
----

TIP: Single-line comments can be used to divide elements, such as two adjacent lists.

----
